  "readme": "BiSON.js - Binary Encoding for JavaScript\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**BiSON** is size optimized binary encoding for JavaScript objects, it was \ndesigned for real time web games and other applications that might be bandwidth \nlimited.\n\n### Output Size\n\nBiSON **saves** between **20 to 45 percent** of size when compared to JSON. With \nthe average saving being around **one third**.\nIn order to achieve a maximum of compression BiSON makes some trade offs, \ntherefore it is not 100% compatible with JSON.\n\n### Valid BiSON\n\n- **true**, **false**, **null**\n- Any Number between **-2147483647.99** and **2147483647.99** (inclusive) \n\n> **Note:** Floats are rounded to 2 decimal places\n\n- **Object** and **Arrays** of any size and nesting depth\n- **Strings** of any length\n\nJust like with JSON, all data needs to be encapsulated in a top level **Array** or **Object**.\n\n> **Important:** For reasons of speed, **BiSON** does **not** perform any validation on the data you pass it.\n> Therefore passing for example Numbers that are not in range will result in malformed output.\n\n### Speed\n\nDepending on the input, BiSON under V8 is between 2 to 5 times **faster** than \nnative JSON and **just as fast** as JSON in Firefox 4 Beta.\n\nFor more detailed results visit the \n[JSPerf Benchmark](http://jsperf.com/bison/6).\n\n",
